# data-backup

I wrote this small go utility to help me archive a folder with valuable project and research info and upload it to google drive.

I have a scheduled windows task running on a weekly basis.

There should be a .env file as part of the directory with the contents

```
BackUpPath=AbsolutePath to your archivable folder
BackUpEmailPassword=SomeEmailPassword
BackUpEmailAccount=SomeEmail
```

Email and password are a TBC and To be Tested feature which should send an email if the archiving or drive uploading goes bust

Another file which should be present is service.json, the contents look like this

```{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "fake-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "fake-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nFake_Private_Key_Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "fake-service-account-email@fake-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "fake-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/fake-service-account-email%40fake-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}```

The above json file can be generated by going to your google developer console and producing a json file(Ref: https://www.daimto.com/google-developer-console-service-account/)

There is also parentFolderId which I have hard coded, it relates to a drive folder where I want my backup to be stored. No need to make it configurable as i will probbaly be the only one to use this.
